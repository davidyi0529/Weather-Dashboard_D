<br />

Daily-Scheduler_D is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

The application contains a work day of 9AM â€“ 5PM, and has areas for entering notes to help the user keep track of their busy schedule. The top of the planner always contains the current date, without the user having to look that up.

### Screenshot with color coding of the exact time of day:
